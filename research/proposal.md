# PROPOSED SOLUTION: THE "CO-REGULATOR" SYSTEM

## 1. AI Interaction: The "Sous-Chef" Model
*   **Concept:** The AI prepares the "ingredients" (information, structure) but leaves the "cooking" (execution) to the user.
*   **Mechanism:** Scaffolding.[9]
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Magic Breakdown:** When a user types a vague task ("Study History"), the AI uses an LLM to decompose it into 3 micro-steps (1. Open book, 2. Read Chapter 1 title, 3. Write one definition).[12]
    *   **Interaction:** The AI never does the work for them (which creates dependency) but removes the cognitive load of *structuring* the work.

## 2. Interaction Design: Digital Body Doubling
*   **Concept:** Mimicking the presence of a human co-worker to anchor attention without social pressure.[13, 14]
*   **Mechanism:** Co-Regulation.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Passive Avatar:** A small, pulsing UI element that signifies "I am here working with you."
    *   **Gentle Check-ins:** If the user goes idle or switches tabs rapidly, the AI asks, "I noticed we drifted. Is the task getting sticky, or are we taking a break?" (Non-judgmental observation).[15]

## 3. UI Component: The "Timeline River"
*   **Concept:** Visualizing time as distance/space to cure Time Blindness.
*   **Mechanism:** Spatial Temporal Mapping.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   A vertical scrolling timeline where a 1-hour task is visually twice as tall as a 30-minute task.
    *   **"Safe Time" Blocks:** The empty space between tasks is colored Green. The AI explicitly labels it: "You have 3 hours of safe focus time here." This eliminates "Waiting Mode" anxiety by validating availability.[4]

## 4. UI Component: The "Focus Card" (Monotropism Support)
*   **Concept:** A "Fortress of Solitude" for the user's attention tunnel.
*   **Mechanism:** Reducing Visual Noise / Polytropic Competition.[16]
*   **Implementation:**
    *   A mode that hides the sidebar, navigation, and other tasks.
    *   The screen displays **only** the current micro-step and a visual timer.
    *   **Result:** It artificially induces a flow state by removing all competitive stimuli.

## 5. Feature: The "Brain Dump" Drawer
*   **Concept:** Addressing Working Memory deficits without breaking flow.
*   **Mechanism:** Cognitive Offloading.[17]
*   **Implementation:**
    *   A persistent "Capture" button (always visible) that opens a text overlay.
    *   User types an intrusive thought ("Buy milk") and hits Enter. The drawer immediately closes.
    *   **AI Role:** The AI sorts this into the correct list later. The user trusts the system to remember, allowing them to let go of the thought instantly.

## 6. Transition Design: "Gearbox" Buffers
*   **Concept:** Helping Autistic users shift attention without pain (overcoming Inertia).[18]
*   **Mechanism:** Sensory Ramping.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Soft Alarms:** Sound fades in from 0% to 100% volume over 30 seconds.[19]
    *   **Interstitial Screens:** Between tasks, a screen appears saying, "Great job. Take a breath. Next task starts in 2 minutes." This provides a "decompression chamber" for the brain to switch contexts.

## 7. Neuroinclusive Design System (Visuals)
*   **Concept:** Minimizing sensory load while maintaining dopamine engagement.
*   **Mechanism:** Halation Reduction & Biophilic Design.[20]
*   **Color Palette Recommendations (Hex Codes):**
    *   **Backgrounds:** Use **Off-White/Cream** (`#F5F5DC`, `#FAFAFA`) or **Warm Grey** (`#EAE7E2`) instead of pure white to reduce eye strain (halation).
    *   **Text:** Use **Dark Slate/Charcoal** (`#2F3E46`, `#363636`) instead of pure black.
    *   **Focus Accents (Biophilic):** **Sage Green** (`#8FBC8F`) for calm focus, **Dusty Blue** (`#778DA9`) for stability.
    *   **Alerts:** Avoid Red (`#FF0000`). Use **Burnt Orange** (`#E76F51`) for missed deadlines to reduce anxiety/RSD.[21]

## 8. Motivation Mechanics: The "Endowed Progress" Effect
*   **Concept:** Engagement without Gamification (no streaks/points).
*   **Mechanism:** Intrinsic Motivation & Competence Visualization.[22]
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **The "Done" List:** Tasks are never deleted; they move to a "Completed" section to visualize the pile of work *finished*.[23]
    *   **Progress Rings:** Every project starts at 5% (not 0%) upon creation to reduce the intimidation of the blank slate.[24]
