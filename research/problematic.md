# RESEARCH FINDINGS: COGNITIVE STRESSORS & EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION

## 1. The "Wall of Awful" (Task Initiation Paralysis)
*   **Target Group:** ADHD
*   **Mechanism:** A biochemical failure in the reward pathway (dopamine deficit) that creates a visceral emotional barrier to starting tasks.[1]
*   **The Problem:** When faced with a generic task (e.g., "Write Essay"), the neurodivergent brain cannot generate enough endogenous dopamine to overcome the activation energy required to start. This is not "laziness"; it is a paralysis where the task feels physically painful or impossible to approach.[2]
*   **UI Trigger:** Blank pages, empty dashboards, or unprioritized "To-Do" lists that require high executive function to organize.

## 2. Temporal Myopia (Time Blindness & Waiting Mode)
*   **Target Group:** ADHD
*   **Mechanism:** A deficit in temporal processing where time is perceived not as a continuous linear progression, but as two states: "Now" and "Not Now".[3]
*   **The Problem:**
    *   **"Not Now":** Future deadlines feel non-existent until they become immediate crises.
    *   **"Waiting Mode":** If an event is scheduled for later (e.g., 4:00 PM), the brain cannot gauge "how much" time exists before then. Paralyzed by the fear of hyperfocusing and missing the event, the user does nothing all day.[4, 5]
*   **UI Trigger:** Standard calendar grids that show time abstractly rather than spatially.

## 3. Monotropic Split (Interruption Trauma)
*   **Target Group:** Autism (Asperger's)
*   **Mechanism:** "Monotropism" describes an attention style where resources are highly concentrated in a single "attention tunnel" (flow state).[6]
*   **The Problem:** Shifting attention requires a massive cognitive load to dismantle the current tunnel and build a new one. Being forced to switch tasks unexpectedly (e.g., by a notification) can cause physical pain, disorientation, and "meltdowns" due to the sudden fragmentation of processing resources.[7]
*   **UI Trigger:** Pop-ups, modal windows, or aggressive notifications that demand immediate attention.

## 4. Object Permanence Deficits ("Out of Sight, Out of Mind")
*   **Target Group:** ADHD
*   **Mechanism:** A working memory deficit where information that is not currently visible is effectively deleted from the conscious mind.[2]
*   **The Problem:** If a tool, task, or idea is hidden inside a menu or tab, the user forgets it exists. Conversely, if everything is visible, it causes visual overwhelm.
*   **UI Trigger:** Nested menus, complex navigation trees, or hiding active tasks in "backlogs."

## 5. Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)
*   **Target Group:** ADHD & Autism
*   **Mechanism:** An extreme, physical emotional sensitivity to perceived rejection, failure, or criticism.[8]
*   **The Problem:** Negative feedback loops in software (e.g., "You missed your goal," red text, broken streaks) trigger a shame spiral. To avoid this shame, the user will abandon the app entirely.
*   **UI Trigger:** Red error messages, "Overdue" labels, and "Streak" mechanics that reset to zero.

## 6. Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) / Drive for Autonomy
*   **Target Group:** Autism & ADHD
*   **Mechanism:** An anxiety-driven resistance to everyday demands. The brain perceives a direct command (even from an app) as a threat to autonomy, triggering a fight-or-flight response.[9]
*   **The Problem:** If the AI acts as a "Boss" telling the user what to do, the user will instinctively resist or invent reasons not to do it.
*   **UI Trigger:** Imperative language ("Do this now"), rigid schedules that cannot be changed, and lack of "Exit" buttons.

## 7. Sensory Gating Failure (Visual Vibration)
*   **Target Group:** Autism
*   **Mechanism:** The inability to filter out irrelevant sensory data.[10]
*   **The Problem:** High-contrast visuals (pure black on pure white), erratic animations, or cluttered layouts create "visual noise." This depletes the energy available for processing tasks, leading to rapid fatigue.[11]
*   **UI Trigger:** Pure black (#000000) backgrounds, high-saturation accent colors, and autoplaying motion.
